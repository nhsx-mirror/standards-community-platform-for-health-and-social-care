# Standards community platform for health and social care 
This platform is open to anyone who uses, develops, commissions, owns or assures standards, services and APIs relating to interoperable technology in health and social care. 

## How this platform works
The platform is hosted on GitHub, an open source platform designed for collaboration. 

You will need a [public GitHub account](https://github.com/) if you want to comment, start a discussion or make a contribution to the standards community development backlog.

You do not need to create a GitHub account to browse and search.  

## What you can do on the platform

The platform has two main areas. In the:

- [standards community development backlog](https://github.com/Marvell-Consulting/standards-directory-community-platform/projects/1), 
you can read proposals for new standards, proposals for extensions or changes to existing standards, raise your own issue using a template and comment on others’ proposals

- [discussions forum](https://github.com/Marvell-Consulting/standards-directory-community-platform/discussions),
you can read discussions on local specifications, use cases and standards implementation, post a new discussion and respond to others’ posts
 

You can find more information about how to contribute on the [contribution guidance page in the standards directory (opens in new window)](https://nhs-standards-registry.herokuapp.com/v5/community-contribution).


## Support
The standards directory team moderate the standards community development backlog and the discussions forum.
