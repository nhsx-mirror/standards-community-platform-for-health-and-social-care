# Standards community platform for health and social care 
## Note: This platform is part of ongoing research on community contributions in conjunction with the [NHSX Standards Directory](https://github.com/nhsx/standards-registry-discovery)

This platform is open to anyone who uses, develops, commissions, owns or assures standards, services and APIs relating to interoperable technology in health and social care. 

## How this platform works
The platform is hosted on GitHub, an open source platform designed for collaboration. 

You will need a [public GitHub account](https://github.com/) if you want to comment, start a discussion or make a contribution to the standards community development backlog.

You do not need to create a GitHub account to browse and search.  

## What you can do on the platform

The platform has two main areas. In the:

- [discussions forum](https://github.com/nhsx/standards-community-platform-for-health-and-social-care/discussions),
you can read discussions on local specifications, use cases and standards implementation, post a new discussion and respond to othersâ€™ posts

- [standards community development backlog](https://github.com/nhsx/standards-community-platform-for-health-and-social-care/projects/1), 
you can view and submit improvements or report a bug to the standards directory

## Ways to contribute
Anyone can contribute to the community backlog. All you need is a [public GitHub account](https://github.com/) to get started. Most contributions begin with a GitHub issue using one of these templates:
- [suggest an improvement to the standards directory](https://github.com/nhsx/standards-community-platform-for-health-and-social-care/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=3-suggest-a-new-feature-or-improvement-to-the-standards-directory.md&title=)
- [report a problem or bug with the standards directory](https://github.com/nhsx/standards-community-platform-for-health-and-social-care/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=4-report-a-problem-with-the-standards-directory.md&title=)

To feedback or share insights on something that already exists:
- find the issue in the community backlog - in the [issues list](https://github.com/nhsx/standards-community-platform-for-health-and-social-care/issues) or [community backlog](https://github.com/nhsx/standards-community-platform-for-health-and-social-care/projects/1)
- add a comment to that issue

## Maintaining the backlog
The [standards directory team](standards.directory@nhsx.nhs.uk) moderates and maintains the standards community backlog and the discussions forum. It labels, manages and closes issues on this GitHub repository.
